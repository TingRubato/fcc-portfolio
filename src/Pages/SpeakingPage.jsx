        <div className="desc">
          <p>
            Welcome and thanks for visiting. To start with, I'd like to share
            with you what I have discovered in leading personal and professional
            development workshops over the past years.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have discovered the kind of interactions taking place in a family
            also occur in the workplace. I believe wholeheartedly that the
            negotiating strategies necessary for building relationships and
            handling tough conversations apply to both family and work life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Part of the success of an event depends on how successfully a
            speaker speaks their audience's language and relates their personal
            experiences to the larger picture. My process includes a personal
            consultation with you to better understand how to best serve you
            and your audience. Many of my topics can be adapted to fit your
            time frame, whether you would like a workshop, keynote address, or
            retreat. I will work with you to meet your schedule.
          </p>
          <p>
            As you read through these descriptions, you will see acronyms such
            as F.A.S.T., G.R.E.A.T., and F.E.A.R., as well as systematic methods
            like the Match and Move Method and Hide and Seek Method. This is
            purposeful. As both an educator and professional speaker, I designed
            these programs to be easily remembered by my audiences—and, if truth
            be known, by me as well.

            This online parenting group or introductory presentation provides
            parents with the foundation for the Stop Struggling With Your Teen
            program. Participants will discover the three most common mistakes
            parents make that leave them feeling frustrated, fed up, and
            exhausted from arguing with their teen.
          </p>
          <p>Afterwards, participants will be able to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Squash power struggles before they begin.</li>
            <li>
              Increase their teen's feelings of self-worth immediately by
              changing just one word they say.
            </li>
            <li>
              Connect more and argue less with their teens by uncovering the
              most common, but unknown, mistakes parents make.

            Based on Evonne Weinhaus' updated and expanded best-selling book for
            parents with kids aged 8-18, this presentation teaches a four-step
            approach:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Thinking Differently</li>
            <li>Turning Over Responsibility</li>
            <li>Tapping into Parents' Rights</li>
            <li>Taking a Stand</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Participants will take home specific, concrete solutions they can
            apply immediately. Afterwards, they will be able to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Establish a non-threatening, peaceful atmosphere.</li>
            <li>Revitalize healthy communication with their teen.</li>
            <li>Stop unnecessary conflict without giving in.</li>
            <li>
              Raise their teen to be equipped with the skills to become
              responsible, well-adjusted adults.
            </li>

          <p>
            Participants will take a quick survey to identify their individual
            problem-solving style and learn how to identify others' styles.
            Evonne contends that within every group, there are four styles: the
            results-oriented type, the attention-getter relationship type, the
            pleaser, and the just-the-facts accountant type. The insights gained
            will be immediately useful.
          </p>
          <p>Afterwards, participants will be able to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Enter another person's world, communicate with flexibility, and
              customize their approach.
            </li>
            <li>
              Apply a fun, entertaining approach to strengthen relationships and
              minimize conflict.
            </li>
            <li>
              Understand how others think and make decisions to collaborate more
              effectively.

            Learn how to break through walls of resistance and resolve conflict.
            Discover the skills to listen better, talk straighter, and move into
            action using Evonne’s "Match and Move Method." This proprietary
            method transforms a "who will win" attitude into a "what to do"
            strategy.
          </p>
          <p>Afterwards, participants will be able to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Match others' views to be on the same wavelength.</li>
            <li>
              Move cooperatively to solutions that include joint input and focus
              on solving the problem, not attacking each other.
            </li>
            <li>
              Move against resistance by using impersonal language and creating
              an action plan with follow-through.

          <p>
            Evonne, who recovered from brain surgery, uses her life story to
            help people understand they also have a story to tell. Fear, a
            powerful emotion, unknowingly drives behavior. Evonne’s "Hide and
            Seek" method offers a groundbreaking way to address fear.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>F.ace fear: Name their fear.</li>
            <li>
              E.mbrace fear: Claim the old baggage they are still carrying.
            </li>
            <li>
              A.ce the fear: Unmask “Hide and Seek” behaviors that unknowingly
              drive their lives.

              love, not fear.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Evonne's audiences leave inspired, fortified, and renewed, with
            strategies for becoming their true fearless selves.
